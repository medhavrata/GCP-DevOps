## Compute

- Compute Engine (Virtual Machine)

- Cloud Run:
  - This is used to run stateless HTTP containers

  - On GCP, open the console -> make a new directory and put the source code/Docker file -> enable the cloudrun/container registry APIs -> run
    'gcloud run deploy' command to deploy the app as container
  
- Cloud Functions:
  - This is being used to handle HTTP requests or events from many GCP resources
  - Cloud functions is used for single purpose actions


- App Engine: 
  - This is a PAAS service
  - This will start a VM to host the applications
  - On GCP, open the console -> make a new directory to host the source code -> put all the required source files for the application -> enable
    the App Engine API-> run 'gcloud app deploy' to deploy the applicaiton to App Engine -> Application will be running
